<h2>The Singleton Pattern</h2>

Singleton pattern is a design solution where an application wants to have one and only one instance of any class, in all possible scenarios without any exceptional condition. It has been debated long enough in java community regarding possible approaches to make any class singleton. Still, you will find people not satisfied with any solution you give. They cannot be overruled either. In this post, we will discuss some good approaches and will work towards our best possible effort.

<h3>How to Implement</h3>

1. Add a private static field to the class for storing the singleton instance.

2. Declare a public static creation method for getting the singleton instance.

3. Implement “lazy initialization” inside the static method. It should create a new object on its first call and put it into the static field. The method should always return that instance on all subsequent calls.

4. Make the constructor of the class private. The static method of the class will still be able to call the constructor, but not the other objects.

5. Go over the client code and replace all direct calls to the singleton’s constructor with calls to its static creation method.

<h3>Pros and Cons of the Singleton design pattern</h3>

Pros:

1. You can be sure that a class has only a single instance.
2. You gain a global access point to that instance.
3. The singleton object is initialized only when it’s requested for the first time.

Cons:

1. Violates the Single Responsibility Principle. The pattern solves two problems at the time.
2. The Singleton pattern can mask bad design, for instance, when the components of the program know too much about each other.
3. The pattern requires special treatment in a multithreaded environment so that multiple threads won’t create a singleton object several times.
4. It may be difficult to unit test the client code of the Singleton because many test frameworks rely on inheritance when producing mock objects. Since the constructor of the singleton class is private and overriding static methods is impossible in most languages, you will need to think of a creative way to mock the singleton. Or just don’t write the tests. Or don’t use the Singleton pattern.

<h3>Relations with Other Patterns</h3>

- A Facade class can often be transformed into a Singleton since a single facade object is sufficient in most cases.

- Flyweight would resemble Singleton if you somehow managed to reduce all shared states of the objects to just one flyweight object. But there are two fundamental differences between these patterns:
  - There should be only one Singleton instance, whereas a Flyweight class can have multiple instances with different intrinsic states.
  - The Singleton object can be mutable. Flyweight objects are immutable.
- Abstract Factories, Builders and Prototypes can all be implemented as Singletons.
